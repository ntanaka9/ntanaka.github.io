This WOD was teaching us how to create a sales receipt table.  We had to make a table containing 5 different products with their prices and compute the tax, subtotal, and grand total. 
Here is a link for further details: <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html">

My first try at this WOD was difficult because I forgot to change the item1, quantity1, and price1 to the appropriate product numbers.  I knew I needed to copy the table code, but wasn't sure where to place it on the file.  After viewing the screencast it all made sense and was easy to proceed.

This WOD was different because we used a lot of calculations, whereas the BrowserHisotry6 did not have any calculations.  We had to assign a lot of variables which we did not do for BrowserHistory6.  We had to create a table which we haven't done in the previous BrowswerHisotry.  BrowserHisotry6 helped us learn how to insert pictures and create button links, whereas this WOD just used one html page.

I probaby could have done better if I researched more about how to create a table with calculations on Google.  I will try to study and research more on the next WOD and hopefully I can complete it without any help.
