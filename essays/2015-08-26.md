My name is Nami and my major is in MIS.  I was originally going to major in Business Management.  My brother majored in Computer Science and made it sound interesting so I decided to learn about management information systems and how they are used in business.  Our future is in technology so I would like to be prepared for jobs that require technical skills.  All sucessful businesses use technology and knowing how to use it will help me with any job.
