<p>1. My programming skills have greatly improved.</p>
<p>I agree that my programming skills have greatly improved. I didn't know anything about how coding worked and now I have some idea on how to use them to format webpages.  I didn't know how to use tags (<>) to format a webpage before.  There are different codes you can use that will generate the same result.  I learned how to use both and definitely like to use the easier way, but it is still important to know there are other ways to do it.  You just need to find out which way will work for the type of webpage you are creating.</p> 

<p>2. I am enthusiastic about programming.</p>
<p>I agree that I am enthusiastic about programming because it is so cool how things can generate.  For example, using a loop for the invoice page instead of repeating more code for each item.  When there is an error in my code, I get excited once it is fixed and my webapge works.  Simple things such as putting an extra ";" or forgetting to put one in the code will cause a code to not work.  Finding these mistakes makes you feel dumb, but in the end the outcome will give you happiness and a feeling of success.</p>

<p>3. I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions.</p>
<p>I do not think I can do all the WODs without the screencast solutions.  I may be albe to do a few, but it would take be a while to figure out.  I think the instructions for the WODs that didn't have screencasts could have been a little more specific or worded differently.</p>

<p>4. The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.</p>
<p>The labs definitely helped me to learn how certain codes work.  Going through the labs with you helped explain why things do what they do.  For example in Lab 15 we learned why each user has a different output session, it is because each is uniquely generated.  The labs help a lot because they are crucial for understanding how to do the assignments.</p>

<p>5. I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications).</p>
<p>I feel I am ready to move to the next stage in programming because I have a better understanding of how coding works.  If I am stuck on how to do something, I can do my own research on different codes.  I learned that we need to do a lot of our own research for this class.</p>

<p>6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning.</p>
<p>I don't have any suggestions on how the class can improve.  I liked the way the class was structured such as going through the labs together.  We need to do a lot of learning on our own and if you do the reasearch this class will be easy.  You are available and glad to help when students need it.</p>

<p>7. There are things that work really well my learning in this class.</p>
<p>Going over the labs are things that work well with my learning in this class. If we had to do them on our own, I would be lost.  You explain things very well and give examples of bad coding and good coding so we know why is it important to know about them.</p>
