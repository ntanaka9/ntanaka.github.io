<p>1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details.</p>
<p>For assignment 2 we were to create a login page and registration page for new users. Users would have to log in before being directed to the invoice page. Here is a link for <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html">further details.</a></p>

<p>2. What did you learn from this assignment?</p>
<p>I learned how to add code to the server.js in order for the login and registration pages to work. We have to create a file that provides the users information and stores them.</p>

<p>3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).</p>
<p>I did not have a partner.</p>

<p>4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?</p>
<p>I reached out the the professor to help me with inputting the login and registration coding into the file server.js. I also asked some classmates for help on styling my page.</p>

<p>5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?</p>
<p>We had to add more functions to our web application such as the user login and registration. We made it more secure and personalized than for assignment 1. </p>

<p>6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</p>
<p>I spent about 20% of my time thinking about how to implement my page. About 60% of my time writing code. And about 20% testing and debugging.</p>

<p>7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?</p>
<p>As I got help from the professor, the project stated to go very well. We made sure everything worked. What did not go well was beofre I asked for help. I couldn't figure out how to really add to the server.js file and make my login and registration page work.</p>

<p>8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</p>
<p>I would have asked for help from the professor earlier. I tried doing it on my own, but just couldn't figure things out. Starting earlier would have made this easier as well.</p>
