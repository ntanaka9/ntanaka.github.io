<p>I didn’t have much trouble in BrowserHistory1 because the steps were easy to follow.  I had to research what the EMMET boilerplate was and how to use it in VS code.  I finished this within Rx time at about 13 minutes.</p>

<p>For BrowserHistory2 I was stuck on changing the font to Open Sans so I watched the screencast and it showed how to input the tag.  It still did not work and when I typed in open sans in VS code there was an option to select sans-seriff so I tried that and it worked.  I had to research the codes on how to make the font color, change the margins, change the text width, change the background, and make the logos to be inline.  I also finished this in Rx time at about 7 minutes, but had trouble in the beginning so I had to do it about 4 times.</p>

<p>BrowserHistory3 took me about 7 minutes as well.  I had to search on Google all the codes to use to make the layout appear as it was supposed to.  Sometimes the page wouldn’t load properly and so I had to do a hard refresh and that would show the final layout.  I had to record this WOD 6 times because the browser would not refresh and show the changes that I made.  I learned later in class about the hard refresh.</p>

<p>I enjoyed learning these codes for the layouts of web pages.  It is frustrating at times but feels really good once you complete them.  You just need to do your own research on codes and see what works for yourself instead of just watching the screencast which will not help you learn better.</p>
